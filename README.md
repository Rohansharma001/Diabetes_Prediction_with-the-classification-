🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Classification – Description

This project aims to predict whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic using machine learning classification techniques. The model is trained on medical and lifestyle attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, age, and pregnancy count. Classification algorithms analyze patterns in historical health data to accurately classify diabetes outcomes. The system supports early detection of diabetes, enabling timely medical intervention and improved healthcare decision-making.

🔹 Short Version (Resume / Dashboard)

A machine learning–based diabetes prediction system that classifies patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using medical and demographic data.

🔹 Technical Version (Documentation)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, followed by feature selection and scaling. Classification models are trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure reliable predictions.
